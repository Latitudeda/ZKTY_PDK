===================

Define the WG class which consists of ``STRIP.C.WIRE``, and ``RIB.C.WIRE`` class. The width of the waveguide is set here according the parameters in ``constant.py`` file. **PhotoCAD** also support CD bias control of the waveguide width. The CD bias setting can be implemented in ``strip.py``, and ``rib.py``.
